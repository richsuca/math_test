# Math Quiz
To get my son to practise his multiplication tables, I started with an Excel based question generator. Then got tired of it and wrote an interactive question and answer program in Python. Then I added addition and subtraction and eventually a sqlite database so I can analyse his weakness. Works with both OS X and Windows 7.
